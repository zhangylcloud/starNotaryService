## Example with cURL:
This has the examples of GET/POST requests. You can't run it directly. 
You need to use your own bitcoin public address and sign it with your bitcoin core

This sends a validation request using my public address
```curl -d '{"address":"mnckZaQxZu3x7QuNkSG3zFQZYMFxzntmtX"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8000/requestValidation```

This sends a validate request to verify the signature, you need to use your own bitcoin core to find your signature
```curl -d '{"address":"mnckZaQxZu3x7QuNkSG3zFQZYMFxzntmtX", "signature":"IOuW1k+fVvyvunG+ptVZdEaT5UfF2a3MFl9gMw/bL2NmH6ygWf+MTar2ux79xcTKUwzoZFyUQbdN6vcPRiG32QI="}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate```

This registers a star on blockchain. The json file with star info is in star1.json. please run from tests directory so star*.json can be read.
